# AGENTS.md

This file is an index. Load the right skill guides for your task.

## Boot Sequence

1. Read your task on VibeKanban (`Msc Math Viterbo`).
2. Run `uv run python scripts/load_skills_metadata.py` (or `--quiet` when scripted) to surface skill summaries.
3. Open the skills that match your scenario using the map below. Treat those files as the authoritative source.

## Skill Map

### Governance & Collaboration

- `skills/roles-scope.md` — ownership, responsibilities, escalation triggers.
- `skills/collaboration-reporting.md` — communication hygiene, weekly reporting, artefact handling.
- `skills/vibekanban.md` *(if present)* — board workflows (fallback to `skills/daily-development.md` otherwise).

### Maintaining Skills & Docs

- `skills/skill-authoring.md` — how to create or update skills to Anthropic spec (authoritative).

### Environment & Tooling

- `skills/devcontainer-ops.md` — host/container lifecycle scripts.
- `skills/environment-tooling.md` — command palette, PDF ingestion, shell practices.
- `skills/notebook-etiquette.md` — reproducible notebook workflows and artefact storage.

### Daily Execution

- `skills/repo-onboarding.md` — startup checklist and command quick reference.
- `skills/daily-development.md` — planning cadence, just-command flow, PR expectations.
- `skills/testing-workflow.md` — lint/test commands, incremental selector, troubleshooting.

### Code & Architecture

- `skills/coding-standards.md` — PyTorch-first conventions, typing, docstrings, C++ guidance.
- `skills/math-layer.md` — symplectic geometry focus, tensor semantics, invariants.
- `skills/architecture-overview.md` — layer responsibilities and extension strategy.
- `skills/performance-discipline.md` — benchmarking, profiling, and optimization policy.

### Repository Layout

- `skills/repo-layout.md` — canonical locations for configs, docs, tests, and artefacts.

## Maintaining Skills

- When adding or updating skill files, follow `skills/skill-authoring.md` and ensure metadata stays current.
- `just lint` validates frontmatter via `scripts/load_skills_metadata.py --quiet`; fix warnings before handoff.
