# Writing (Mails & Thesis)

## Instructions
- Prefer concise summaries with links to artefacts; avoid committing large binaries.
- Keep thesis text and references under `thesis/`; follow advisor/owner expectations for scope and cadence.
- For emails, paraphrase and archive summaries under `mail/archive/`; keep private attachments in `mail/private/`.

## Weekly Summaries

- Capture progress, decisions, and next steps; link tasks and artefacts.
- Coordinate with the project owner before committing reports; keep repo history focused on source changes.

## Thesis & Longform

- Maintain structure under `thesis/` and keep references in the project bibliography.
- Summarize enduring technical insights in `docs/` or skills after validation.
