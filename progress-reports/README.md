# Weekly Progress Mail Assets

This folder holds the assets required to prepare and archive the weekly supervisor email.

- Start each draft from `weekly-mail-template.md`.
- Use `weekly-mail-prompt.md` with Codex to bootstrap the first draft.
- Store finalised drafts in `drafts/` with filenames `YYYY-MM-DD-weekly-mail.md`.

See `progress-reports/AGENTS.md` for the detailed workflow and style guidance.
