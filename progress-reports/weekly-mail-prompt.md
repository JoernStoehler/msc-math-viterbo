# Weekly Progress Mail — Drafting Prompt

You are assisting with a weekly email to the thesis supervisor. Produce a concise, professional draft following `progress-reports/weekly-mail-template.md`.

## Context Gathering Checklist
Before writing, inspect the repository:
1. Read `docs/02-project-roadmap.md` for the current phase and milestones.
2. Review the latest commits since the previous weekly mail (use `git log --since="last friday" --oneline`).
3. Skim any newly edited files under `thesis/` for structural changes worth mentioning.
4. Check open TODOs or notes in `docs/` that changed during the week.

## Drafting Instructions
- Start with a two-bullet summary that highlights impactful outcomes.
- In “Progress since last update”, group related work together; mention chapter names or figure additions when relevant.
- For “Plans”, describe concrete next actions tied to the roadmap.
- For “Blockers”, explicitly state “None this week.” if there are no issues.
- Use British spelling and a professional, upbeat tone.
- Keep the entire email under 250 words.

## Output Format
Return only Markdown suitable for an email client, preserving the headings in the template.
