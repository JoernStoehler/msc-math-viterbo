    """Ekeland–Hofer–Zehnder capacity via the Artstein–Avidan–Ostrover program.

    The H-representation ``\langle n_i, x \rangle \leq c_i`` allows one to
    express ``c_EHZ`` as the optimum of a convex quadratic program in the
    positive weights ``\lambda_i`` subject to the linear closure constraint
    ``\sum_i \lambda_i n_i = 0``:

    .. math::

       c_{EHZ}(K) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \min_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \sum_i
       \lambda_i c_i \right)^2,\quad \Lambda = \{\lambda_i \ge 0 : \sum_i
       \lambda_i n_i = 0,\ \sum_i \lambda_i = 1\}.

    Implementation plan:

    1. Pre-scale ``(n_i, c_i)`` so that each facet has unit outward normal to
       avoid ill-conditioning, then factor the closure constraint with a QR
       decomposition ``N^T = QR`` where ``N`` stacks the normals.
    2. Solve the reduced strictly convex quadratic program
       ``min_{\mu >= 0, 1^T \mu = 1} (1/2) ||R^T \mu||_2^2 + \mu^T c`` using a
       projected Newton or an interior-point method implemented with torch
       linear algebra. Determinism is preserved by fixing pivoting strategies.
    3. Recover the contact points ``x_i`` via ``torch.linalg.lstsq`` applied to
       the active facet normals and return ``c_EHZ = sum_i \lambda_i c_i`` with
       the associated certificate (multipliers, facets) for downstream checks.

    Artstein-Avidan & Ostrover (2004, Theorem 1.6) and Ostrover & Wagner (2014)
    guarantee that in the smooth strictly convex case the minimiser corresponds
    to a closed characteristic whose supporting facets are exactly those with
    ``\lambda_i > 0``. The algorithm will explicitly surface this set so
    ``minimal_action_cycle`` can reconstruct the billiard.

    Args:
      normals: ``(F, d)`` float tensor of outward normals ``n_i``.
      offsets: ``(F,)`` float tensor of offsets ``c_i`` with ``c_i > 0``. Inputs
        must describe a compact convex body containing the origin in its
        interior; degeneracies (redundant facets, offset sign changes) should be
        filtered before invoking the solver.

    Returns:
      Scalar float tensor giving the EHZ capacity of the convex body.

    For a convex polytope provided in V-representation this routine will host a
    combinatorial search inspired by Gluskin & Ostrover (2014) and the discrete
    symplectic billiard models of Artstein-Avidan, Karasev & Ostrover (2014).
    Candidate closed characteristics correspond to cyclically ordered vertex
    sequences ``(v_{i_1}, …, v_{i_k})`` satisfying the momentum closure
    condition ``\sum_j (v_{i_{j+1}} - v_{i_j}) = 0``. The action of such a
    cycle is computed by integrating the Liouville 1-form along the piecewise
    linear path; the minimum positive action equals ``c_EHZ``.

    Implementation plan (restricted to Lagrangian products where Minkowski
    billiards are valid):

    1. Accept ``vertices`` paired with a factorisation ``R^{2n} = R^n_x × R^n_y``
       coming from :func:`lagrangian_product` and only enumerate billiard words
       that alternate between the two factors.
    2. Formulate the incidence constraints as a mixed-integer linear program
       (variables for vertex selection, equality constraints for balance) and
       solve it with a deterministic branch-and-cut (e.g., SCIP via python
       bindings) seeded by the :func:`capacity_ehz_algorithm1` multipliers.
    3. Evaluate the action integral exactly on the recovered cycle and refuse to
       return a value when the polytope is not a Lagrangian product, deferring to
       :func:`capacity_ehz_algorithm1` or :func:`capacity_ehz_primal_dual`.

    Args:
      vertices: ``(M, d)`` float tensor with ``d`` even. The vertices should
        affinely span the polytope; duplicates are tolerated but incur redundant
        candidates.

    Returns:
      Scalar float tensor with ``c_EHZ`` once the discrete search is implemented.

      of ``vertices``.
    * For Lagrangian products (where Minkowski billiards apply) reuse the vertex
      cycle from ``capacity_ehz_algorithm2`` and lift it to a continuous closed
      characteristic using the Dell'Antonio–Vitali (2020) contact form.
    * Provide a post-processing stage that validates the equal-incidence
      condition and re-integrates the Liouville form to ensure the reported
      capacity matches the supplied orbit, flagging unsupported geometries
      instead of silently returning incorrect cycles.

    Args:
