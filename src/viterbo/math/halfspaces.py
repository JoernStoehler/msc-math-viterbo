"""Stubs for half-space representation conversions and utilities.

Planned features:
- Convert vertex set -> half-space (H-rep) for convex polytopes (CPU; C++ optional).
- Robust handling of degenerate/ragged inputs; return normals and offsets.
- Compute support functions and separating hyperplanes.
