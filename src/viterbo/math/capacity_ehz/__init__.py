"""EHZ capacity algorithms and minimal-action cycles.

This subpackage groups related algorithms and utilities:
- ``algorithms`` for capacity solvers
- ``lagrangian_product`` for vertex-billiard solvers on K Ã— T
- ``cycle`` for minimal-action cycle front-ends
- ``ratios`` for derived quantities (e.g., systolic ratio)
- ``stubs`` for planned/experimental solvers

Import concrete functionality from submodules; no re-export indirection.
