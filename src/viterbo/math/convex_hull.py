"""Stubs for convex hull and related polytope data.

Planned features:
- Convex hull of point clouds with outputs: vertices, faces/facets, incidence.
- Simplicial decomposition and triangulations where needed for integration/volume.
- Optional adapters to C++/Qhull via a wrapped module if warranted.
