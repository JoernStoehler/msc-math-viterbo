"""Shared dataclasses describing modern polytope artefacts.

The classes in this module are lightweight containers that will become pytrees
once we wire them into JAX transformations. They intentionally avoid providing
behaviour today; instead, they document how we expect to pass information
between pure math routines and dataset adapters.
