# Thesis Source Layout

This directory contains the LaTeX sources that will be synced with Overleaf.

## Files
- `main.tex` — master document that stitches the thesis together.
- `frontmatter/` — short sections such as the abstract and acknowledgements.
- `chapters/` — per-chapter content (see `chapters/introduction.tex` for the placeholder outline).
- `figures/` — committed figures (keep raw exports elsewhere).
- `references.bib` — BibTeX database.

Refer to `thesis/AGENTS.md` for detailed conventions.
