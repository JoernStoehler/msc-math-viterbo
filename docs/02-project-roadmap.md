# Roadmap

_Last reviewed: 2025-10-02._

This roadmap balances literature work with incremental, testable Python code and reflects the
current repository state.

## Current snapshot

- Symplectic capacity definitions, inequalities, and algorithm sketches are consolidated in the
  research notes on capacities and related docs, giving Phase 1 a solid reference
  base.【F:docs/13-symplectic-quantities.md†L1-L116】【F:docs/convex-polytope-cehz-capacities.md†L1-L73】
- The Python package now includes deterministic polytope constructors and transforms, a reproducible
  search enumerator, JAX‑first reference/fast volume backends (with SciPy calls centralized in
  wrappers), and a systolic‑ratio wrapper on top of the EHZ implementations, providing the tooling
  for large‑scale
  experiments.【F:src/viterbo/geometry/polytopes/reference.py†L1-L200】【F:src/viterbo/optimization/search.py†L1-L100】【F:src/viterbo/geometry/volume/reference.py†L1-L40】【F:src/viterbo/geometry/volume/fast.py†L1-L40】【F:src/viterbo/symplectic/systolic.py†L1-L120】
- Thesis scaffolding and the weekly mail workflow are in place, so planning tasks can tie directly
  into drafting and reporting cadence.【F:thesis/README.md†L1-L12】【F:AGENTS.md†L338-L350】
- Experiment evaluation methodology and the live portfolio (including SWE-first tasks) now live
  under `docs/tasks/`, giving agents a shared quantitative prioritisation
  framework.【F:docs/tasks/01-task-evaluation-methodology.md†L1-L203】【F:docs/tasks/02-task-portfolio.md†L1-L151】【F:docs/tasks/template.md†L1-L53】

## Phase 1 — Foundations

Status: ✅ Core references drafted.

- Maintain the capacity definitions and reading list as new papers surface.
- Promote any ad-hoc notes from `tmp/` into the research docs to keep the foundation synced with the
  code base.

## Phase 2 — Techniques & Results

Status: 🟡 Iterating on coverage of results and algorithms.

- Expand the partial results section to highlight gaps the experiments could address.
- Capture benchmarking ideas for the algorithms already surveyed so they can graduate into
  reproducible tests later.
- Continue tagging open questions or proof sketches with TODO markers that link back to thesis
  chapters.

## Phase 3 — Python Implementation & Experiments

Status: 🟡 Core utilities landed; experiments need structuring.

- Execute the research‑portfolio infrastructure tasks (T1/T2): structure quantity modules around
  reference/fast (JAX‑first) splits with shared kernels and central wrappers, and land the shared
  testing/benchmarking
  harness.【F:docs/tasks/completed/2025-10-04-geometry-module-refactor.md†L1-L120】【F:docs/tasks/scheduled/2025-10-04-testing-benchmark-harness.md†L1-L84】
- Harden performance-sensitive kernels with additional benchmarks and profiling hooks before scaling
  search runs.
- Integrate additional symplectic invariants (e.g., cylindrical capacity bounds) reusing the
  existing polytope abstractions.
- Add higher-level experiment scripts or notebooks that combine `search`, `volume`, and `systolic`
  helpers to generate reproducible datasets.

### Active milestone — Thesis-aligned experiment plan

- Sync the LaTeX outline with concrete computational objectives (link code modules to
  chapters/sections).【F:thesis/README.md†L1-L12】
- Define the first batch of search/volume experiments and record acceptance criteria directly in the
  roadmap so they feed the weekly progress
  workflow.【F:src/viterbo/optimization/search.py†L22-L91】【F:AGENTS.md†L345-L350】
- Ensure each experiment has an auditable path from raw polytopes to reported systolic ratios,
  including tests that guard against
  regressions.【F:src/viterbo/symplectic/systolic.py†L20-L80】【F:tests/symplectic/test_systolic.py†L1-L42】
- Cross-reference the priorities in `docs/tasks/02-task-portfolio.md` when planning weekly work so
  infrastructure refactors and numerical studies stay
  aligned.【F:docs/tasks/02-task-portfolio.md†L1-L151】

## Phase 4 — Synthesis

Status: 🔜 Thesis drafting scaffolded, content to follow.

- Use the experiment outputs to populate thesis chapters and figures incrementally.
- Consolidate limitations, benchmarking results, and open questions alongside the narrative.

Tracking: Use GitHub Issues with the RFC template for larger design notes; smaller tasks as issues
with clear acceptance criteria. Update the weekly mail drafts with roadmap deltas each Friday to
maintain alignment.【F:AGENTS.md†L345-L351】
