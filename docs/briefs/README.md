# Briefs Index

This directory tracks higher-level workflows supporting the symplectic polytope program. Files in the root are
considered active references; historical or superseded material lives under `archive/`.

## Active briefs

- `2025-10-12-workflow-reading-list.md` — curated references grouped by thematic tracks.
- `2025-10-12-workflow-thesis-topic-probing-viterbo.md` — MSc thesis topic transcription with execution outline aligned to the current codebase.
- `2025-10-12-workflow-capacity-algorithms.md` — survey of planned EHZ capacity algorithms and references.
- `2025-10-12-workflow-volume-algorithms.md` — overview of exact and approximate volume estimators for convex polytopes.
- `2025-10-12-workflow-task-evaluation.md` — policy for scoring task briefs and experiments.

## Historical briefs

Superseded task/workflow documents recovered during the forensics pass were moved to `archive/`. Treat them as
context only; they may reference modules that no longer exist in the modern stack.
