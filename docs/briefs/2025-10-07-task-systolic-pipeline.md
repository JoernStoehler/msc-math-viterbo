# Systolic computation pipeline

## Motivation

We need a robust, modular implementation to compute \(\text{sys}(X)\) efficiently across large polytope families, as outlined in the ChatGPT Pro plan’s engineering milestones.

## Scope

- Build core libraries for polytope representations, smoothing, volume calculation, and combinatorial Reeb orbit enumeration.
- Provide performance instrumentation covering runtime vs. facet count and action cutoffs.
- Offer numerical robustness modes (float64, interval arithmetic, rational support) with clear toggles.

## Deliverables

1. Library modules aligning with the plan’s `Polytope4D`, `ReebOrbit`, and `Smoothing` data models.
2. Benchmark scripts documenting scaling behaviour, feeding into repository performance baselines.
3. User documentation explaining configuration options and recommended workflows.

## Dependencies & Links

- Consumes theoretical work from [Combinatorial Reeb model formalization](2025-10-07-task-combinatorial-reeb-formalization.md).
- Relies on regression fixtures defined in [Baseline invariants](2025-10-07-task-systolic-baselines.md).
- Supports [Landscape scans and reproductions](2025-10-07-task-systolic-landscape-scans.md), [Rigorous certificates](2025-10-07-task-systolic-certificates.md), and [Machine learning program](2025-10-07-task-systolic-ml-program.md).
- Shares performance insights with [Advanced optimization and analysis directions](2025-10-07-task-systolic-advanced-directions.md).

## Status Tracking

Update the YAML header as modules land; keep notes on performance regressions or toolchain needs.
