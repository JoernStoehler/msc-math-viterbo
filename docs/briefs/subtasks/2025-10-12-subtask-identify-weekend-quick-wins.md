# Subtask: Identify weekend quick-win ideas

## Context

- We need compelling deliverables to present to the thesis advisor after the weekend sprint.
- Multiple workstreams (datasets, notebooks, tooling, docs) are in-flight; some may have low-effort extensions worth highlighting.
- Prior briefs capture strategic goals but no curated list of quick wins.

## Objectives (initial draft)

- Survey current progress and backlog to spot tasks achievable within the weekend window.
- Prioritise ideas by impact-to-effort ratio and relevance to advisor expectations.
- Present recommendations with suggested owners, dependencies, and expected artefacts.

## Deliverables (tentative)

- Short brief or report enumerating 3–5 high-value quick-win proposals with rationale; each idea can reasonably fit within a few days of focused work (≈three dependent research milestones deep).
- Mapping from each idea to existing subtasks/briefs (if any) for traceability.
- Optional calendar/checklist to track weekend execution.

## Dependencies

- Requires current status inputs from active subtasks (dataset, notebooks, tooling, documentation) to judge feasibility.
- Needs clarity on team availability during the weekend to calibrate scope.
- Should align with advisor expectations gathered from previous meetings or communications.

## Acceptance criteria (to validate completion)

- The quick-win report lists each proposal with effort estimate, expected artefacts, required collaborators, and blocking dependencies.
- Recommendations prioritise ideas by impact versus effort and explicitly flag any risks or assumptions.
- Scheduling or checklist artefacts support coordination across the weekend, even if lightweight.
- The document stands alone: readers unfamiliar with prior chats can act on the plan immediately.

## Decisions and constraints

- Advisor focus is broad; no specific theme preference beyond high impact.
- Highlight demonstrable artefacts (figures, datasets, notebooks) while noting any foundational prerequisites.
- Typical risks are time overruns or scope creep; these should surface during planning or review rather than via heavy contingency docs.
- Anything viewable directly on the PI's laptop counts as advisor-ready output—no extra slides required.
- Coordinate scheduling with active subtasks; delay the idea-gathering effort if resource conflicts arise.

## Open Questions

1. What timeframe defines the “weekend” window (hours available, team capacity)?

## Notes

- Capture owner assignments for each idea as part of the report to streamline follow-up subtasks.
