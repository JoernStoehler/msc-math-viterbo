# Initial Context Breakdown

> Non‑normative snapshot: This analysis explains a past session’s context. Policies and workflows
> are defined in `AGENTS.md` and repository configs; if anything here conflicts with those sources,
> prefer `AGENTS.md` and configs.

## Distinct Components

1. **System Message**
   - Provides role assignment (ChatGPT, gpt-5-codex) and global workflow mandates (commit + make_pr
     sequence, citation format, final message structure, screenshot expectations, environment usage
     constraints, final answer templates, PR guidelines, and code style rule about avoiding
     try/except around imports).
   - Establishes repository location, environment guidelines, and the requirement to reference
     AGENTS.md instructions.
1. **Tool Specifications**
   - Defines the available tool namespaces (`container`, `browser_container`) and enumerates their
     callable functions along with input schema constraints and channel usage rules.
1. **Conversation Metadata**
   - States the valid communication channels (`analysis`, `commentary`, `final`) and the initial
     token budget (`Juice: 64`).
1. **User Message**
   - Requests capturing the full initial context verbatim in `docs/98-codex-cloud-context.md` and an
     explanatory analysis in `docs/99-codex-cloud-context-discussion.md`.
   - Asks for clarification if there are misconceptions about context composition and notes the use
     of XML-like tags for the message boundaries.

## Interpretation & Notes

- No developer messages or additional higher-priority instructions are present, so the system
  message is the top-level authority before the user request.
- The initial context consists strictly of the system message (including the embedded specifications
  and guidelines), the tool documentation, conversation metadata, and the user's XML-tagged
  instructions—there is no separate environment creation transcript beyond the repo path statement.
- The user's understanding aligns with the actual context structure: the context is composed of the
  system prompt and ancillary specifications, plus the user's own message. There is no version drift
  apparent relative to the described expectations.
- Both newly created documentation files fall under the root-level `AGENTS.md`, so all
  repository-wide conventions (e.g., line length, formatting norms) continue to apply. No nested
  `AGENTS.md` overrides exist within `docs/`.
