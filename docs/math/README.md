# Math Docs

This folder collects math‑focused notes: curated reading, topic briefs, and implementation‑adjacent pointers for the Viterbo conjecture and related symplectic/convex geometry.

What’s here (local notes index)
- Reading list (canonical): `docs/math/reading-list.md`
- Thesis topics and implementation notes: `docs/math/thesis-topics.md`

Adding more notes
- Drop any new Markdown file in `docs/math/` — there’s no need to touch `docs/03-conventions.md`.
- The reading list above is the single source of truth (no duplicates).
