# Viterbo Conjecture — MSc Thesis Reading List

> How to use this list. Bullets are grouped (Essentials → Algorithms → Background/Context). Each entry has a text citation, a clickable link, a “what you’ll learn” blurb, and an effort estimate ⏱ in relative units only (1u ≈ a short skim; 2–3u ≈ careful read; 5–8u ≈ deep/technical). Priorities are marked with ⭐.

This file was moved from `docs/math/reading-list.md` to keep docs flat and numbered.

## F) Quick order‑of‑reading

1) Haim‑Kislev & Ostrover (2024) → 2) Viterbo (2000) → 3) A‑A/K/O (2013/14) → 4) Chaidez–Hutchings (2020) → 5) Leipold–Vallentin (2024) → 6) Rudolf (2022/24) → 7) Krupp (2020 + code) → 8) Brunn–Minkowski (2007/08) → 9) Long–Zhu (2002, selective) → 10) any ECH‑caps survey (Hutchings).

Notes for implementation (skim)
- For experiments on polytopes in R^4: start with Chaidez–Hutchings orbits, validate via Rudolf/Krupp; expect NP‑hard worst cases; use heuristics, symmetry and caching.
- For products K×K^∘ and dualities: combine Artstein‑Avidan–Karasev–Ostrover with Shi/Vicente to pick promising families.
- Maintain a small unit‑test zoo for normalization/scaling checks.
