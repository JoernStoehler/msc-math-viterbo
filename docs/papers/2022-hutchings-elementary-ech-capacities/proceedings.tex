\section{Introduction}

Top quark production in association with a vector boson provides an important probe of the electroweak couplings of the top quark.
As precise predictions within the standard model (SM) of particle physics become available, inclusive and differential cross section measurements can be used to test our theoretical understanding of the production mechanisms.
The experimental results are also used to constrain models of physics beyond the SM, e.g.\ through interpretations in the framework of the SM effective field theory.

Results of the ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS-Experiment} and CMS~\cite{CMS-Experiment} experiments for inclusive cross section measurements of top quark pair (\ttbar) and single top quark (t) production in association with a photon (\mygamma), a Z~boson, or a W~boson are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:summary}.
For the results, the experiments used proton-proton (pp) collision data recorded at \sqrts between 2015 and 2018 at the CERN LHC.
In this contribution, the most recent results for \ttbar\mygamma, \ttbar Z, and tZq production are presented.

\section{Measurements of \texorpdfstring{\ttbar\mygamma}{ttG} production}

The ATLAS Collaboration measured \mygamma-associated top quark production in e\mymu events, using 139\perfb of data~\cite{ATLAS-ttG}.
A fiducial phase space is defined at parton-level for the combined \ttbar\mygamma and tW\mygamma production as signal process.
A template fit is performed to the scalar $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ sum of the reconstructed objects (photon, leptons, jets).
The inclusive cross section is measured with a precision of 6.3\%, and found in agreement with the dedicated SM prediction from Ref.~\cite{theory-ttG1, theory-ttG2}.

The CMS Collaboration measured \ttbar\mygamma production in $\ell$+jets ($2\ell$) events, using 137\perfb (138\perfb) of data~\cite{CMS-ttGsl, CMS-ttGdi}.
A fiducial phase space for both measurements is defined at particle-level.
For the $\ell$+jets analysis~\cite{CMS-ttGsl}, a template fit is performed to the invariant mass distribution of the three selected jets, split by lepton flavour and jet multiplicity, and background contributions are constrained from control regions.
The inclusive cross section is measured with a precision of 6.1\%.
For the $2\ell$ analysis~\cite{CMS-ttGdi}, a template fit is performed to the photon $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ distribution, split by lepton flavour.
The inclusive cross section is measured with a precision of 3.8\%.
Both results are found in agreement with the SM expectation as evaluated with an MC event generator.

All three results also present differential cross section measurements, and apply unfolding procedures to correct for detector resolution effects and to extrapolate the distributions to the fiducial phase space at parton- (ATLAS) or particle-level (CMS).
Two examples are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ttG}, and are compared to different SM predictions.

}
\label{fig:ttG}
\end{center}


\section{Measurements of \texorpdfstring{\ttbar Z}{ttZ} production}

The \ttbar Z production process was measured in $3\ell$ and $4\ell$ events by the CMS Collaboration using 77.5\perfb of data~\cite{CMS-ttZ}, and by the ATLAS Collaboration using 139\perfb of data~\cite{ATLAS-ttZ}.
In both measurements, a template fit is performed to the distributions of lepton, jet, and b-jet multiplicity.
The inclusive cross section is measured by the CMS Collaboration with a precision of 8.2\%, and by the ATLAS Collaboration with a precision of 9.5\%.
Both results are in agreement with each other, and also in agreement with the dedicated SM prediction from Ref.~\cite{theory-ttZ}.

In both results, differential cross section measurements are presented as well.
For the CMS result, two distributions are measured in $3\ell$ events, and an unfolding procedure is applied to correct for detector resolution effects and to extrapolate to parton-level.
For the ATLAS result, several distributions are measured for different channels, and are extrapolated to parton- or particle-level.
Two examples are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ttZ}, and are compared to different SM predictions.

}
\label{fig:ttZ}
\end{center}


\section{Measurements of tZq production}

The tZq production in the $3\ell$ channel was measured by the ATLAS Collaboration in events with 2--3 jets using 139\perfb of data~\cite{ATLAS-tZq}, and by the CMS Collaboration in events with at least two jets using 138\perfb of data~\cite{CMS-tZq}.
In both measurements, a machine-learning discriminant is trained to distinguish between the tZq signal and background processes (especially \ttbar Z and diboson production).
Template fits are performed to the discriminant distributions, split by jet and b-jet multiplicities, and background contributions are constrained from control regions.
The inclusive cross section is measured by the ATLAS Collaboration with a precision of 14\%, and by the CMS Collaboration with a precision of 11\%.
Both results are in agreement with each other, and are also in agreement with the SM expectation evaluated in Ref.~\cite{CMS-tZq-pred}.

The CMS Collaboration also performed a differential cross section measurement, using a multiclass machine-learning discriminant to distinguish simultaneously between the tZq signal and the different classes of background processes.
A likelihood-based unfolding procedure is applied to correct for detector resolution effects, to extrapolate to parton- or particle-level, and to also constrain background contributions from control regions.
Two examples are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tZq}, and are compared to different SM predictions.

\section{Summary}

Cross section measurements of top quark production in association with a photon or a Z~boson, performed on proton-proton collision data recorded at \sqrts with the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC, are presented.
Very precise results are obtained for the inclusive production cross sections, and found in agreement with the expectation from the standard model of particle physics.
Various differential distributions are measured as well, and unfolding procedures are applied to present differential cross sections at parton- and particle-level.
