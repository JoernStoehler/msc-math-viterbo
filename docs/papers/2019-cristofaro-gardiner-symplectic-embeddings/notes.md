# Symplectic embeddings from concave toric domains into convex ones

The Journal of Differential Geometry publication is available via Project Euclid (https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-112/issue-2/Symplectic-embeddings-from-concave-toric-domains-into-convex-ones/10.4310/jdg/1559786421.pdf). The site only distributes a PDF, and no LaTeX source is publicly linked. Because PDFs cannot be committed to this repository (Codex Cloud bug) and no alternative text source is provided, this directory records bibliographic metadata only.
