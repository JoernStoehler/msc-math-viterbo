# Irrelevant/Tangential — Tracked for Completeness

This list contains items that passed early search filters but are currently judged not relevant enough for the MSc thesis focus (EHZ capacity on convex bodies, Viterbo’s conjecture, and closely related embedding/capacity topics). Keep entries so we do not re-triage them later. If scope changes, move entries to `index.md` with an updated status.

- Gajewski, Goldin, Safin, Singh, Zhang (2019) — “Optimization on Symplectic Embeddings” (private preprint)
  - Reason: private/unpublished; ML/optimization framing without concrete results needed for our capacity focus.

- Liu, Yi, Zhang, Huang (2023) — “Symplectic Structure‑Aware Hamiltonian (Graph) Embeddings” — arXiv:2309.04885
  - Reason: ML/graph methods; does not address symplectic capacities/convex body regime.

- Misc. toric quantum homology without capacity applications (various)
  - Reason: interesting background, but not directly used for EHZ/Viterbo results in convex bodies.

Note: If a paper reappears as a necessary background citation for a core argument, move it back to `index.md` with status `background`.
