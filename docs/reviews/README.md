# Reviews — Index and Conventions

Purpose
- Central index for all repository reviews. Each review focuses on a single topic to produce a long, unfiltered, unsorted list of findings. Results feed into consolidation and planning.

How to add a review
- Create: `docs/reviews/XX-<stub>.md` where `XX` is a zero‑padded topic number.
- Content: be thorough; unsorted is fine; redundancy OK. Use clear, specific language. No length limit.
- Deliverable path: keep the file under `docs/reviews/` so it publishes and is easy to reference.
- Cross‑link: add a single bullet link here after saving the file.
