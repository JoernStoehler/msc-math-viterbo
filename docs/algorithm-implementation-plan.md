# Implementation Plan for Priority Algorithms

This document scopes the implementation work for the algorithms called out as high-value in the
capacity and volume notes. The plan emphasises separation between mathematically faithful reference
implementations and performance-oriented fast variants, with shared infrastructure, validation, and
profiling strategies that keep both aligned.

Status tags: unmarked items remain in progress; entries labelled `[done]` are completed and
`[blocked]` items require follow-up decisions or dependencies.

## 1. Scope and guiding conventions

- Algorithms covered: the six EHZ-capacity approaches and six polytope-volume methods marked as
  promising in `docs/convex-polytope-cehz-capacities.md` and `docs/convex-polytope-volumes.md`.
- Code layout: colocate the reference and fast variants under domain-specific packages (JAX‑first),
  with SciPy/NumPy interop centralized in `viterbo._wrapped/`. For EHZ capacity, algorithms live
  under `src/viterbo/symplectic/capacity/` grouped by family (e.g.,
  `facet_normals/{reference.py,fast.py,subset_utils.py}`). Prefer direct imports from the concrete
  modules over wrapper layers.
- Reference vs fast:
  - Reference modules optimise for clarity and correctness, relying on straightforward numerical
    methods (dense linear algebra, exact arithmetic libraries, generic solvers).
  - Fast modules focus on asymptotic improvements (sparser data structures, caching, incremental
    updates) only after profiling demonstrates a bottleneck. They may require additional optional
    dependencies guarded by feature flags.
- Validation philosophy:
  - Cross-check against analytical values for cubes, simplices, cross-polytopes, and Lagrangian
    products with known capacities/volumes.
  - Compare algorithmic outputs after symplectic/affine normalisations to ensure invariance.
  - Use reference implementations as oracles for the fast counterparts on random polytopes in low
    dimension, and compare different algorithms where theoretical equality/ordering holds.
- Tooling:
  - LP: adopt a single JAX‑first path. JAXopt’s OSQP wrapper is deprecated, so evaluate a
    maintained replacement before adding a new dependency; keep SciPy/NumPy interop under
    `viterbo._wrapped/` only.
- MILP: standardise on HiGHS via `highspy` with direct use and no abstraction. Place any interop
  code under `viterbo._wrapped/` or keep in notebooks/scripts.
  - Reuse existing half-space and vertex utilities in `viterbo.geometry.polytopes` for conversions
    and canonicalisation.

## 5. Testing, benchmarking, and documentation roadmap

1. **Testing layers**
   - Unit tests per module validating mathematical identities and edge cases.
   - Property-based tests using `hypothesis` (optional dependency) for random polytopes subject to
     invariance checks.
   - Integration tests that compare outputs across algorithms (e.g., Viterbo inequality
     `c_EHZ^n ≤ n!·vol`).
1. **Benchmark suites**
   - For each fast implementation, add `@pytest.mark.benchmark` tests and profile runs via
     `just profile` before deciding on micro-optimisations.
   - Record baseline metrics in the repository wiki or docs for trend tracking.
1. **Documentation**
   - Update `docs/convex-polytope-cehz-capacities.md` and `docs/convex-polytope-volumes.md` with
     implementation status tables.
   - Provide API reference snippets in `docs/README.md` once modules are stable.
1. **Dependency management**
   - Keep a single golden-path environment; add new dependencies only with maintainer approval. If a
     MILP stack is selected, pin it directly (no generic backends).
   - Document solver installation notes (if any) alongside the owning task; avoid optional extras
     unless justified by policy waiver.
1. **Release criteria**
   - Reference implementations must match literature benchmarks within numerical tolerance.
   - Fast implementations should demonstrate measurable speed-ups (>2×) on profiling benchmarks
     before being advertised as default.
   - All new modules require docstrings, jaxtyping annotations, and coverage in tests/benchmarks.

## 6. Open questions and sequencing

- Prioritise EHZ facet-normal and Reeb enumeration first to unlock validation pathways for other
  capacity algorithms.
- Evaluate the practicality of Barvinok and SDP dependencies early; if bindings prove unstable,
  consider delegating these paths to CLI wrappers instead of Python APIs.
- Decide whether to expose fast implementations behind feature flags (e.g., environment variable
  `VITERBO_USE_FAST=1`) or via explicit API choice.
- Land the HiGHS via `highspy` plumbing (wrappers, dependency pin) and keep interop under
  `_wrapped/` if promoted beyond notebooks.
- Defer deep optimisation passes until profiling reveals hotspots; focus on correctness and
  cross-validation harnesses in the initial milestone.

This plan should feed into task breakdowns for upcoming sprints and guide dependency onboarding
discussions before implementation begins.
