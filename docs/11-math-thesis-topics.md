# Thesis Topics â€” Placeholder

The previous summary for the thesis topic options contained factual mistakes, so it has been
removed. We will replace this file with an exact transcription of the official PDF from the
supervising professor. Until that happens, defer to direct guidance from the professor or the
maintainer when selecting or scoping thesis work.

If you need to coordinate thesis planning before the transcription is added, post an update in the
weekly mail thread or contact the maintainer directly.
