# Task Brief Template

Use this scaffold when drafting a new task or experiment brief. Delete sections that are not relevant, but keep the headings order so other agents can parse documents quickly.

- **Status**: Draft | RFC | Scheduled | In Progress | Completed
- **Last updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Owner / DRI**: <name or "Unassigned">
- **Reviewers**: <optional>
- **Related docs**: <links to roadmap, progress reports, prior briefs, AGENTS items>

## 1. Context and intent
Summarise the motivating question or problem, the background references, and why the task matters now. Mention upstream docs (e.g., algorithm plans, meeting notes) that frame the work.

## 2. Objectives and non-goals
List the concrete outcomes we expect (what success looks like). Under a separate sub-list, state explicit non-goals to prevent scope creep.

### In scope
- itemised deliverables

### Out of scope
- intentional exclusions and deferrals

## 3. Deliverables and exit criteria
Describe artefacts that must exist at completion (code modules, datasets, documents, benchmarks). Provide crisp acceptance tests or observable signals.

## 4. Dependencies and prerequisites
Identify tasks, datasets, theoretical results, or environment features required before starting. Note blocking vs. soft prerequisites.

## 5. Execution plan and checkpoints
Lay out the major steps, ordered where possible. Include checkpoints or review gates (e.g., initial inventory, mid-task validation, final review). Mention expected iteration counts when helpful.

## 6. Effort and resource estimates
Use qualitative bins (low/medium/high) for:
- Agent time
- Compute budget
- Expert/PI involvement

Note any reevaluation points where we can stop early.

## 7. Testing, benchmarks, and verification
Specify which automated checks (format, lint, typecheck, unit, benchmark tiers) must run in CI vs. locally. Mention manual validation (e.g., spot-check datasets, visual inspections) as needed.

## 8. Risks, mitigations, and escalation triggers
Enumerate major risks or unknowns, mitigations, and when to escalate (e.g., unclear invariants, tooling gaps, missing data). Align with AGENTS escalation policy.

## 9. Follow-on work
List potential subsequent tasks unlocked by this work or items deferred for later. Use bullet points for easy grooming.

Add additional sections (e.g., glossary, research questions) when specialised tasks warrant them. Keep the brief concise enough that another agent can onboard within minutes.
