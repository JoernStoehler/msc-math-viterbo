## Summary

Implement two random polytope generators: (1) via random halfspaces and (2) via random vertices. Focus on reproducibility (seedable), removal of redundancies, and returning both V and H reps.

## Delivered

- `random_polytope_algorithm1` and `random_polytope_algorithm2` now live in `src/viterbo/math/random_polytopes.py` with deterministic seeding.
- `tests/test_math_random_polytopes.py` validates reproducibility and geometry invariants for 2D/3D fixtures.

## Deliverables

- Implement `random_polytope_algorithm1(seed, num_facets, d)`.
- Implement `random_polytope_algorithm2(seed, num_vertices, d)`.
- Ensure both return `(vertices, normals, offsets)` and are deterministic for a fixed seed.
- Add smoke tests with small `d` (2, 3) verifying closed/valid polytopes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- CI green (lint/type/smoke).
- No implicit device moves; fixed seeds produce identical results.
- Document limits and potential degeneracies.

## Status Log

- 2025-10-14 â€” Archived after confirming deterministic generators now live in `src/viterbo/math/random_polytopes.py` with smoke coverage documenting limitations.
