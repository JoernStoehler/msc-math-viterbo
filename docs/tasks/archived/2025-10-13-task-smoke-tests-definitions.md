## Summary

Design minimal smoke tests (function presence, basic invariants, shapes/dtypes) for the implemented math modules so future enhancements land with immediate validation.

## Delivered

- `tests/test_smoke.py` exercises core geometry helpers, dataset/collate flows, and the demo probe to guarantee importability and fast end-to-end checks.
- Added pytest markers (`pytestmark = pytest.mark.smoke`) for easy incremental selection and CI gating.
- Added dedicated smoke suites `tests/math/test_polytope_smoke.py` and `tests/math/test_volume_smoke.py` covering support queries, pairwise distances, halfspace violations, and volume routines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- CI green (lint/type/smoke).
- Tests remain light (<1s locally), readable, and stable across devices.
- New smoke modules pass standalone (`uv run pytest tests/math/test_polytope_smoke.py tests/math/test_volume_smoke.py`).

## Status Log

- 2025-10-15 â€” Added dedicated smoke suites for polytope primitives and volume helper plus expanded integration coverage in `tests/test_smoke.py`; merged to `main`.

## Follow-on Checklist

- [ ] Extend `tests/test_smoke.py` (or sibling modules) whenever new math/dataset/model surfaces land, keeping runtime under ~1s.
- [ ] Document runtime expectations and deterministic seeds alongside new smoke coverage.
