## Summary

We can look for simple polytopes with sys>1 with low vertex / facet counts, by sampling the space and if that's not good enough, follow trajectories of sys constrained to the space of low vertex / facet count to a local maximum. Hopefully, that maximum will have crossed into sys>1 then.
