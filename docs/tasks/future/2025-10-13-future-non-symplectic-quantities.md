## Summary

Non-symplectic quantities may still be useful to add to the dataset, since e.g. Viterbo is true for 4d polytopes and maybe (check lit) 6d polytopes of form KxK^o i.e. mahler-conjecture like. Latter are a subset of their symplectic equivalence class, and continuity says that's still just a subset of the connected component of {sys<1} polytopes. So despite not being a symplectic point of view, they exhibit interesting behavior. Similarly for non-symplectic classes of polytopes (aka binary labels) we may investigate non-symplectic quantities.
