## 1. Context and intent

Pyright strict mode currently rejects imports and decorators from JAX, blocking further work on the
geometry quantity variants. RFC 002 recommends providing repository-local type stubs and lightweight
wrappers so strict type checking remains effective without suppressions. This task schedules the
stub tree implementation and any supporting helpers needed to make the geometry modules type-clean.

## 2. Objectives and non-goals

### In scope

- Provide a repository-local stub hierarchy that covers the subset of JAX APIs used in
  `src/viterbo/`.
- Ensure Pyright strict passes across the repository without inline `type: ignore` directives for
  JAX usage.
- Document the stub maintenance workflow and integration points in developer-facing docs.

### Out of scope

- Expanding geometry functionality beyond existing behaviour.
- Introducing new runtime dependencies or altering the golden-path environment.
- Resolving broader JAX-on-device or GPU support questions.

## 3. Deliverables and exit criteria

- A committed stub hierarchy under `typings/jax/` with coverage for `jax`, `jax.numpy`, `jax.lax`,
  and decorators invoked in the codebase.
- Updated `pyrightconfig.json` to include the stub path (configured as `"stubPath": "typings"`).
- Passes `uv run pyright` without JAX-related diagnostics.
- Contributor documentation describing how to extend the stubs when new APIs are adopted.

## 4. Dependencies and prerequisites

- Final decision recorded in [RFC 002](../../rfc/002-jax-pyright-typing-options.md).
- Access to existing geometry modules to inventory required JAX symbols.
- Coordination with maintainers if the stub path needs CI configuration adjustments.

## 5. Execution plan and checkpoints

1. Inventory JAX symbols used across `src/` and `tests/`, prioritising geometry modules.
1. Generate `.pyi` stubs for the needed modules, modelling signatures on official docs and existing
   type hints.
1. Integrate the stubs via `pyrightconfig.json` and run Pyright to validate coverage.
1. Draft documentation updates (e.g., contributor guide or geometry README) summarising stub usage
   and maintenance expectations.
1. Final review to ensure no runtime changes slipped in and that strict type checking remains green.

## 10. Progress (2025-10-05)

- Local JAX stubs added under `typings/jax/` (e.g., `typings/jax/__init__.pyi`,
  `typings/jax/numpy/__init__.pyi`, `typings/jax/lax.pyi`, `typings/jax/random.pyi`).
- `pyrightconfig.json` is configured with `stubPath = "typings"`.
- Pyright currently reports numerous type mismatches at the JAX/NumPy boundary (tests and examples
  pass `np.ndarray` where functions are annotated with `jaxtyping.Array`).

Next steps:

- Decide bridging strategy for `np.ndarray` vs. JAX array in types (e.g., widen accepted input types
  in tests/examples or add Protocols/overloads where appropriate).
- Expand stubs for any missing JAX decorators/types encountered during the sweep and re-run Pyright
  to converge to zero JAX-related diagnostics.
- Capture the maintenance note in contributor docs once the approach stabilises.

## 6. Effort and resource estimates

- Agent time: Medium (est. 1-2 focused sessions).
- Compute budget: Low (type checking and unit tests only).
- Expert/PI involvement: Low (review of stub coverage if needed).

## 7. Testing, benchmarks, and verification

- Mandatory: `uv run pyright` after stubs integrate.
- Optional: `uv run pytest tests/geometry -q` to guard against regressions during refactorings that
  introduce typed wrappers.
- No performance benchmarks required.

## 8. Risks, mitigations, and escalation triggers

- **Risk**: Stub drift when JAX APIs change → **Mitigation**: Document update workflow and include
  routine validation in task follow-ups.
- **Risk**: Missing decorator behaviours (`jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`) → **Mitigation**: Provide typed
  wrappers or protocol definitions as needed; escalate if semantics unclear.
- **Escalation triggers**: Pyright still reports diagnostics after stub integration, or the task
  reveals broader dependency configuration issues.

## 9. Follow-on work

- Implement helper wrappers for higher-order decorators (`jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`) if upcoming tasks
  require richer typing.
- Evaluate automated checks (e.g., stub-mypy sync) once the stub tree stabilises.
