# Task Brief — Geometry quantity module restructure and JAX baselines

- **Status**: Completed
- **Last updated**: 2025-10-06
- **Owner / DRI**: Unassigned
- **Related docs**: `docs/tasks/01-task-evaluation-methodology.md`,
  `docs/tasks/02-task-portfolio.md`, `docs/algorithm-implementation-plan.md`,
  `docs/22-code-structure.md`

## 1. Context and intent

The geometry package originally mixed reference algorithms, optimisation shortcuts, and experimental
implementations inside shared modules. We moved to a per‑quantity folder layout containing JAX‑first
reference implementations alongside fast variants, with SciPy/NumPy interop centralized in
`viterbo._wrapped/`. This enables clear comparisons, trustworthy datasets, and consistent APIs for
downstream work.

## 2. Objectives and non-goals

### In scope

- Introduce per-quantity packages (e.g., `viterbo.geometry.volume`, `viterbo.geometry.polytopes`)
  each with `__init__.py`, helper modules, fixtures, and example data.
- Provide reference implementations (`*_reference.py`) that favour readability and alignment with
  the mathematical definitions.
- Add `fast.py` siblings where performance is beneficial; ensure signatures remain comparable to
  `reference.py`. Keep JAX as the default array runtime; confine SciPy calls to wrappers under
  `viterbo._wrapped/`.
- Seed each quantity package with small curated example datasets and documentation on how to select
  implementations.
- Draft initial JAX coverage targeting linear-algebra kernels that unblock dataset generation for
  Experiment E1.
- Document migration notes for contributors (e.g., import paths, helper relocation) and update
  public APIs accordingly.

### Out of scope

- Wholesale rewrites of algorithms beyond what is needed to factor shared helpers.
- High-performance GPU kernels or distributed execution.
- Adding new mathematical quantities beyond those already listed in the algorithm implementation
  plan.

## 3. Deliverables and exit criteria

- Updated directory layout under `src/viterbo/geometry/` reflecting the quantity-first structure
  with clear module docstrings.
- Reference and fast (JAX‑first) implementations exposing harmonised signatures and documented
  behaviour differences; wrappers centralizing external interop.
- Regression smoke tests confirming parity between implementation variants on shared fixtures.
- Example datasets stored under each quantity package (e.g., simple polytopes) with loaders or
  helper functions.
- Contributor documentation summarising how to pick between variants, including JAX usage notes and
  any temporary blockers.

## 4. Dependencies and prerequisites

- Inventory of current geometry algorithms and consumers (`rg` scan + reading existing modules).
- Alignment with AGENTS.md conventions (already satisfied by Task 001).
- No external dependencies beyond NumPy/SciPy/JAX; confirm JAX is already available in the
  environment or raise an unblocker.

## 5. Execution plan and checkpoints

1. **Survey (Day 0–1)**: Catalogue existing geometry algorithms, identify candidate quantity
   groupings, and map implicit helpers.
1. **Layout proposal (Day 1)**: Sketch the target directory tree and verify with the maintainer if
   any naming disputes appear.
1. **Reference extraction (Day 2–4)**: Move reference implementations into their packages, add
   module docstrings, and wire shared helpers.
1. **Variant alignment (Day 3–5)**: Adapt fast implementations to the new locations; ensure parity
   tests cover signatures and invariants.
1. **Initial JAX hooks (Day 4–6)**: Port linear-algebra kernels (`standard_symplectic_matrix`, dense
   solves, antisymmetric products) into JAX modules; wrap deterministic enumeration utilities with
   JAX-friendly APIs.
1. **Fixtures and docs (Day 5–6)**: Populate example datasets, update documentation, and write
   contributor notes.
1. **Final review (Day 7)**: Run `just ci`, ensure benchmarks still point to valid paths, and
   request maintainer review with a migration summary.

## 6. Effort and resource estimates

- **Agent time**: Medium (≈ 1.5 agent-weeks)
- **Compute budget**: Low (CPU unit tests and small benchmarks)
- **Expert/PI involvement**: Low (spot-check layout and confirm mathematical invariants if questions
  arise)

## 7. Testing, benchmarks, and verification

- CI: `just format`, `just lint`, `just typecheck`, and targeted unit suites covering moved modules.
- Add or update smoke tests comparing reference vs. fast variants on shared fixtures.
- Optional local run of the medium benchmark tier (\<20 minutes) to confirm no catastrophic
  regressions.

## 8. Risks, mitigations, and escalation triggers

- **Risk**: Hidden coupling between geometry helpers and consumers causes breakage. **Mitigation**:
  Stage refactor with deprecation adapters and run the full unit suite after each quantity move.
- **Risk**: JAX parity harder than expected for SciPy-backed routines. **Mitigation**: Document
  blockers explicitly, keep reference path canonical, and defer advanced kernels to follow-up tasks.
- **Escalation triggers**: Discovery that a required algorithm lacks tests, missing JAX dependency
  support, or inability to harmonise signatures without breaking public APIs.

## 9. Follow-on work

- Task for benchmark and profiling harness (T2) to leverage the new layout.
- Experiment E1 (facet-normal dataset) consuming the refactored modules.
- Future tasks for extending JAX coverage once blockers are resolved (e.g., SciPy replacements).

## 10. Outcome summary

- ✅ Restructured `viterbo.geometry.halfspaces` and `viterbo.geometry.volume` into quantity packages
  exposing JAX‑first reference and fast implementations alongside shared samples and parity tests;
  introduced `viterbo._wrapped/` for SciPy/NumPy boundaries.
- ✅ Completed `viterbo.geometry.polytopes` by adopting JAX‑first internals and wrappers for Qhull;
  combinatorics reuse the JAX half‑space enumerators and shared caching utilities.
- ✅ Added curated half-space and volume datasets plus documentation touchpoints, enabling
  downstream experiments to consume consistent module surfaces.
- ✅ Recorded post-task documentation updates (roadmap, portfolio) and promoted the brief into
  `completed/`, readying T2 as the next dependency.
- ✅ Captured the Pyright–JAX typing trade-off study in RFC 002 to anchor the follow-up
  implementation plan.【F:docs/rfc/002-jax-pyright-typing-options.md†L1-L78】
