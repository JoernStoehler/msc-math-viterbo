# Docs Overview

This folder hosts reference documents. Onboarding and conventions live in `AGENTS.md`.

Numbered docs (lightweight, task‑oriented)
- `01-goal.md` — project goal and context
- `02-roadmap.md` — phased roadmap and tracking guidance
- `03-reading-list.md` — curated reading list for the thesis topic
- `04-thesis-topics.md` — thesis topics and implementation‑adjacent notes

Reference (long‑form, optional reading)
- `working-with-codex.md` — detailed practices and collaboration notes for agents

Conventions for new docs
- Use the filename pattern `<num>-<descriptive-slug>.md` for short/reference notes we expect to keep stable.
- Keep this overview in sync when adding, renaming, or removing docs.
