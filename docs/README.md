# Docs index

The published docs mirror the material most contributors need after reading
`AGENTS.md`:

- **Architecture.** `docs/architecture/overview.md` summarises layering and
  design constraints when you want rationale that goes beyond the high-level
  overview in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Math API.** The `docs/math/` section documents each helper module in
  `src/viterbo/math/`. Start at `docs/math/index.md` and follow the module
  pages for shape/dtype contracts and current limitations.
- **Task backlog.** Managed in the VibeKanban project `Msc Math Viterbo`; tickets link to supporting material in `docs/` when needed. See `docs/workflows-project-owner-vibekanban.md` for board usage.

Everything else (datasets, notebooks, artefacts) is discoverable by browsing
this directory tree directly. Read individual briefs or module docs only when
they are relevant to the task you are implementing.

- Owner workflow. See `docs/workflows-project-owner-vibekanban.md` for the end-to-end
  VibeKanban + devcontainer + remote access runbook used by the Project Owner.

## Notebooks in the Site

- Canonical notebooks live under `notebooks/` as Jupytext `.py` files.
- The siteâ€™s Notebooks section lists executed renders generated by CI.
- Local preview: `just notebooks-md '*.py'` then `uv run mkdocs build --strict`.
