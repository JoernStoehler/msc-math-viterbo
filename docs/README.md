# Docs Overview

This folder hosts reference documents. Onboarding and conventions live in `AGENTS.md`.

Numbered docs (lightweight, task‑oriented)
- `01-project-goal.md` — project goal and context
- `02-project-roadmap.md` — phased roadmap and tracking guidance
- `06-weekly-mail-workflow.md` — weekly supervisor mail drafting routine
- `11-math-thesis-topics.md` — thesis topics and implementation‑adjacent notes
- `12-math-reading-list.md` — curated reading list for the thesis topic

Reference (long‑form, optional reading)
- `21-tool-working-with-codex-agents.md` — detailed practices and collaboration notes for agents
- `22-code-structure.md` — overview of the reorganised package and test layout

Conventions for new docs
- Use the filename pattern `<num>-<descriptive-slug>.md` to keep a manual order independent of slugs.
- We loosely group numbers by area (e.g., 01–09 project meta; 11–19 math; 21–29 tooling), but strict blocks aren’t required.
- Keep this overview in sync when adding, renaming, or removing docs.
